Voltage Divider Setup:

First Resistor (R1): Connect between Arduino TX (5V) and HC-05 RX.
Second Resistor (R2): Connect between HC-05 RX and GND.

How It Works:

The voltage at the HC-05 RX pin (Vout) depends on the values of R1 and R2.
The formula for the output voltage (Vout) is:
𝑉
𝑜
𝑢
𝑡
=
𝑉
𝑖
𝑛
×
(
𝑅
2
𝑅
1
+
𝑅
2
)
V 
out
​
 =V 
in
​
 ×( 
R1+R2
R2
​
 )
In this case, 
𝑉
𝑖
𝑛
V 
in
​
  is 5V from the Arduino.
Using 1kΩ and 2kΩ Resistors:

R1 = 1kΩ
R2 = 2kΩ
Plugging into the formula:

𝑉
𝑜
𝑢
𝑡
=
5
𝑉
×
(
2
𝑘
Ω
1
𝑘
Ω
+

)
V 
out
​
 =5V×( 
1kΩ+2kΩ
2kΩ
​
 )

𝑉
𝑜
𝑢
𝑡
=

𝑉
×
(

)
=
3.33
𝑉
V 
out
​
 =5V×( 
3
2
​
 )=3.33V
This gives a safe voltage level for the HC-05 RX pin, which operates at 3.3V.

Step-by-Step Connection:
Resistor R1 (1kΩ):

Connect one end to the Arduino TX pin.
Connect the other end to the HC-05 RX pin.
Resistor R2 (2kΩ):

Connect one end to the HC-05 RX pin (same point where R1 connects).
Connect the other end to GND.
